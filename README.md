  
Machine Learning and Statistics 2021 Project Submission

GMIT Higher Diploma in Data Analytics

Submitted by Fiona Lee - 19 December 2021

Introduction

This project provides an overview of the scikit-learn and scipy.stats packages.  The project will include demonstrations of three scikit-learn algorithms, a demonstration of a hypothesis test using ANOVA and related visualisation and plots for each.
