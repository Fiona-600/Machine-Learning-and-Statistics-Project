**Machine Learning and Statistics 2021 Project Submission**

**GMIT Higher Diploma in Data Analytics**

**Submitted by Fiona Lee - 19 December 2021**

**Introduction**

This project provides an overview of the scikit-learn and scipy.stats packages.  The project will include demonstrations of three scikit-learn algorithms, a demonstration of a hypothesis test using ANOVA and related visualisation and plots for each.

**Research & Assumptions**




**Conclusions and Findings**



**Structure & Project Navigation**

The project will be stored in a GITHUB Repository at url: https://github.com/Fiona-600/Machine-Learning-and-Statistics-Project

The GITHUB repository contains:

• A *‘gitignore’* file containing any files or file types which should be ignored by the github repository

• A python program file called *‘scikit-learn.ipynb’* which contains the following:

  1. A demonstration of the following three scikit-learn algorithms:

    •	
    •	
    •	
  
  2.	Related visualisation and plots for each algorithm


• A python program file called *‘scikit-stats.ipynb’* which contains:

  1.	A demonstration of a hypothesis test using ANOVA
  
  2.	Related visualisation and plots

• A *‘LICENSE’* file containing a copy of the MIT Licence

• A *‘README.md’* file which contains:

  1.	An introduction to the dataset 
  2.	An explanation of the 'XXX' 
  3.	Conclusions and findings        
  4.	How to run the python code
  5.	References used in completing the project



**Required Programs**

  •	Anaconda Navigator 3 - https://www.anaconda.com/
  •	Jupyter Notebook - https://jupyter.org/install  
  •	Python version 3.8.3 - downloaded via Anaconda Navigator 3 to Windows 10 OS
  •	Cmder Console Emulator - https://cmder.net/
  •	GitHub Repository Storage - https://github.com/
  •	Firefox Internet Explorer - https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/


**Opening and running the code in the Jupyter Notebook**

  1.	Clone or download the github repository 'https://github.com/Fiona-600/Machine-Learning-and-Statistics-Project' onto your local drive
  2.	Open the Jupyter Notebook files in your browser using CMDER
  3.	Use 'Restart and Run All' in the 'Kernel' tab in Jupyter Notebook to re-run the entire code
  4.	Hold 'Shift' + 'Enter' to run/test code in individual code cells in a Jupyter Notebook


**Libraries and Modules**

  •	NumPy - ‘import numpy as np’
  •	Pandas – ‘import pandas as pd’   
  •	From Pandas import Dataframe’       
  •	Matplotlib - ‘import matplotlib.pyplot as plt’
  •	from sklearn.metrics import r2_score 
  •	from sklearn import linear_model   
  •	from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
