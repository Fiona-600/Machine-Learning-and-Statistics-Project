**Machine Learning and Statistics 2021 Project Submission**

**GMIT Higher Diploma in Data Analytics**

**Submitted by Fiona Lee - 19 December 2021**

**Introduction**

This project provides an overview of the scikit-learn and scipy.stats packages.  The project will include demonstrations of three scikit-learn algorithms, a demonstration of a hypothesis test using ANOVA and related visualisation and plots for each.

**Research & Assumptions**




**Conclusions and Findings**



**Structure & Project Navigation**

The project will be stored in a GITHUB Repository at url: https://github.com/Fiona-600/Machine-Learning-and-Statistics-Project

The GITHUB repository contains:

• A ‘gitignore’ file containing any files or file types which should be ignored by the github repository

• A python program file called ‘scikit-learn.ipynb’ which contains:
  •	A demonstrations of the following three scikit-learn algorithms:
      1.	 
      2.	    
      3. 	  
  •	Related visualisation and plots for each algorithm

• A python program file called ‘scikit-stats.ipynb’ which contains:
  •	A demonstration of a hypothesis test using ANOVA
  •	Related visualisation and plots

• A ‘LICENSE’ file containing a copy of the MIT Licence

• A ‘README.md’ file which contains:

  •	Introduction to the dataset 
  •	Explanation of the 'XXX' 
  •	Conclusions and findings        
  •	How to run the python code
  •	References used in completing the project



**Required Programs**

•	Anaconda Navigator 3 - https://www.anaconda.com/
