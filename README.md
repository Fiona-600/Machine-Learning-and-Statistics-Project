• A *‘requirements.txt’* file containing information that facilitates the user to quickly run the notebooks with minimal configuration

• A python program file called *‘scikit-learn.ipynb’* which contains the following:

  1. A demonstration of the following three scikit-learn algorithms:

    •	
    •	
    •	
  
  2.	Related visualisations and plots for each algorithm

<br/>

• A python program file called *‘scikit-stats.ipynb’* which contains:

  1.	A demonstration of a hypothesis test using ANOVA
  
  2.	Related visualisations and plots

<br/>

**Required Programs**

  •	Anaconda Navigator 3 - https://www.anaconda.com/

  •	Jupyter Notebook - https://jupyter.org/install  

  •	Python version 3.8.8 - downloaded via Anaconda Navigator 3 to Windows 10 operating system

<br/>

**Opening and running the code in the Jupyter Notebook**

  1.	Clone or download the github repository 'https://github.com/Fiona-600/Machine-Learning-and-Statistics-Project' onto your local drive
  2.	Open the Jupyter Notebook files in your browser using CMDER
  3.	Use 'Restart and Run All' in the 'Kernel' tab in Jupyter Notebook to re-run the entire code
  4.	Hold 'Shift' + 'Enter' to run/test code in individual code cells in a Jupyter Notebook

<br/>

**Libraries and Modules**

  •	NumPy - ‘import numpy as np’
   
  •	Matplotlib - ‘import matplotlib.pyplot as plt’
