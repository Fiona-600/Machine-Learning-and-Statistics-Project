    "The stats module of SciPy is a statistics library for python containing all of the probability distributions, summary and frequency statistics, correlation functions and statistical tests, masked statistics, kernel density estimation, quasi-Monte Carlo functionality, and others. It is described as being \"like library code in the veins of numpy and scipy\". "

    "\n",
    "Scipy Stats is mainly used for probabilistic distributions and statistical operations.  It is useful for obtaining probabilistic distributions. SciPy Stats can generate discrete or continuous random numbers. It also consists of many other functions to generate descriptive statistical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can also be used to deal with random and continuous variables and to perform 'T-tests' on the data.  The 'T-score' value generated by the T-test describes the relative difference between the mean (average) values of two arrays. The smaller the value, the more similar the arrays are and vice versa."
